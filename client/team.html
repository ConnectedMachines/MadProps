      <h4>Product Owner</h4>
      <p>
        "I'm an engineer at heart; most things I touch get taken apart and rebuilt to be faster, lighter, and contain fewer screws. I pitched and was team lead for Tessel Drone, taking on project management, architecture, and presentation strategy. In my non-existant spare time, I enjoy dogs, games, sailing, and rugby."

      <h2>Geoffrey Abdallah</h2>
      <h4>Scrum Master</h4>
      <p>
        "I'm a software engineer focused on building clean, modular code across the stack. I'm excited about the future of the internet of things and the possibilities microcontrollers like Tessel give to the vibrant open source JavaScript community. I'm comfortable anywhere in the stack - whether it's creating robust UX in an MVC, developing readable and lightweight promise/callback chains for server requests and responses, or architecting a database. In my off time I like to go hiking with my miniature dachshund Momo and to find awesome restaurants."

      <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
      <p>
        "I have always had a lifelong love of learning and a passion for making things. Recently I joined tesselDrone, a group working on creating a drone from scratch using an internet connected micro-controller called Tessel. From my background of working as a stage electrician I was able to manage the hardware aspect of the project. In addition my previous experience as a lab technician creating new testing protocols, gave me the experience necessary to painstakingly discover the proper way to program a black box with no documentation.""
